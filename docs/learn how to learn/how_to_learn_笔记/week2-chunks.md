Chunking is the mental leap that helps 

you unite bits of information together through meaning. 

The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes 

it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you're learning. 

Just memorizing a fact without understanding 

or context doesn't help you understand what's 

really going on or how the concept 

fits together with other concepts you're learning. 

Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the 

puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.
